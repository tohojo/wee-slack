# Changelog

## 3.0.0 (TBD)

### Changes
- The `slack_timeout` is now in seconds instead of milliseconds.

### Features

- Better config options, with sections, types, default values and options per workspace like the IRC config.
- Support for SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies.

## 2.10.1 (2023-09-22)

### Slack API changes

- Fix the connection to the websocket when using session (`xoxc-`) tokens. These connections started failing after a change in the Slack API which made wee-slack unable to run at all (issue #901).

### Bug fixes

- Fix being invited to a private channel not working.
- Add join messages for your own user to hotlist (if unread).
- Prevent errors being printed in core buffer on events for unknown channels.
- Fix rendering of `<` and `>`. A regression in 2.10.0 made these be removed.
- Fix rendering of huddles. A regression in 2.10.0 made the text for huddle messages duplicated.
- Fix rendering of emojis when `render_emoji_as_string` is set to `both`. A regression in 2.10.0 made emojis show twice with this option (PR #902).
- Print an error message when running the `/reply` command without any arguments (issue #900).

## 2.10.0 (2023-08-24)

### WeeChat compatibility

- Support multiline rendering in WeeChat >= 4.0.0.

### Features

- Display link to join huddle when started (PR #885).
- Support Chromium, Chrome and Firefox snap in `extract_token_from_browser.py` (PR #884).
- Detect default Firefox profile in `extract_token_from_browser.py` (PR #887).
- Support specifying profile to use in `extract_token_from_browser.py` (PR #884, PR #887).
- Read new local storage format for Firefox in `extract_token_from_browser.py` (PR #887).
- Automatically enable emoji/usergroups completion.

- Filter channel list based on regular expression (PR #896).

### Bug fixes

- Support `/msg *` in thread buffers (fixes #888).

### Slack API changes

- Fix showing origin channel in previews of Slack messages when a message is linked after it was broken by an API change.

### Other changes

- Include a space between nicks in reaction string.
- Update Dockerfile to use XDG directories (PR #894).

## 2.9.1 (2022-10-30)

### WeeChat compatibility

- Update WeeChat version check to require >= 2.2. The reason for requiring this is that a feature of WeeChat 2.2 (specifying HTTP cookies) is necessary for adding support for the new type of session tokens added in version 2.9.0, so this should have been updated in that version.
- Update usage of some deprecated WeeChat API methods.

### Bug fixes

- Open open IMs and MPIMs on start, not just unread (fixes #875).
- Fix old type MPIMs not being marked as unread on start.
- Evaluate value of the `weechat.look.buffer_time_format` option (fixes #871).
- Fix link previews from apps not being recognized (fixes #834).
- Show useful link for Slack posts.
- Support receiving multiple header blocks in http responses. This was a regression introduced by implementing support for rate limiting in version 2.9.0.
- Fall back to bot id as nick instead of a blank nick if no other info is available (it should be possible to fetch the nick, but that's a remaining bug).

## 2.9.0 (2022-09-19)

Note that Slack will make a breaking change in their API on September 20, 2022 (the day after this release), which means that all earlier versions of wee-slack will stop working. This release adds support for the change and will not be affected by it.

Note that this will most likely be the last release supporting Python 2 (possibly apart from bug fixes and small features). The next major release will most likely require Python >= 3.3 or Python >= 3.6.

### Slack API changes

- Replaces usage of the `rtm.start` API method with other API methods. `rtm.start` will stop working on September 20, 2022 (fixes #866, PR #857).
- Add support for the new type of session tokens (tokens starting with `xoxc-`), i.e. tokens pulled out of the official client which doesn't require registering the wee-slack app in Slack (fixes #844, PR #857).
- Fix message changes not always being processed after API change.

### Bug fixes

- Fix alignment of multi line messages when `weechat.look.prefix_align` is set to `none`.
- Fix compatibility with Python 2, which was broken in version 2.8.0.
- Don't unhide buffers when reprinting messages (PR #839).
- Make sure IMs and group IMs with unread messages are shown at start (fixes #551, PR #859, PR #857).
- Properly retry requests when rate limited (PR #857).
- Fix `/query` command not working for new group IMs (fixes #852, PR #857).
- Include URL in message when block contains a URL (fixes #810, fixes #811, PR #863).

## 2.8.0 (2021-05-11)

### WeeChat compatibility

- Add compatibility with WeeChat >= 3.2 (XDG directories).

### Features

- Include channel name in file names for downloaded files (fixes #836).
- Add indicator for broadcast thread messages (PR #838).

### Bug fixes

- Fix nick not being shown for unknown/external users.
- Fix a bug where the first line would use `prefix_same_nick` after reprinting messages if the first and last message were from the same person.
- Fix some nicks missing in the nicklist of some channels (fixes #829).
- Fix new MPIMs (group private chats) not appearing (fixes #825, fixes #833).
- Fix some MPIMs showing up as private channels.

## 2.7.0 (2021-02-24)

Note that this version changes the default value of the `background_load_all_history` option to `true`, but this will not change for existing installations. It is recommended to set it to `true` unless you experience performance issues. If you keep it at `false` you will experience these issues:

- Channels will not be shown as unread when wee-slack loads, even if there are unread messages. Messages which arrive after wee-slack has loaded however will mark the channel as unread.
- If messages arrive while the connection to Slack is lost (e.g. during suspend), they will not appear in the hotlist.

The reason for these issues now being present with `background_load_all_history` set to `false` is that the API has changed, so we can't check for unread messages without loading the history anymore.

### Slack API changes

- Change to the new Conversations API. The old API will stop working on 2021-02-24, which means that older versions of wee-slack will not work after this (fixes #792).

### Features

- Rewrite how the channel history is fetched. This fixes some issues with fetching history after loosing connection and reconnecting (fixes #629, fixes #715, closes #732, PR #774).
- Change `/rehistory` command to only print the buffer again, not fetch the history from Slack again, unless the `-remote` option is provided.
- Better support for renaming buffers (fixes #563).
- Use the `weechat.history.max_buffer_lines_number` option to decide how much backlog to keep.
- Add an option `history_fetch_count` for how much history to fetch (fixes #376).
- Rename buffers from `<team>.slack.com` to `slack.<team>` (fixes #709).
- Include a prefix character in front of attachments.
- Support colorizing attachment prefix or line (fixes #424, fixes #426).
- Support creating channels with the new command `/slack create` (fixes #415).
- Support custom indent in buflist for threads (see [the last comment](https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack/issues/783#issuecomment-658435310) in #783 for details).
- Support global placement of the `weemoji.json` file.
- Add support to disable teammate link previews (PR #815).

### Bug fixes

- More robust handling of file modes (PR #771).
- Prevent rendering two versions of the message text in certain cases.
- Increase duration of typing notices, so they remain continously for a person that is continously typing, instead of disappearing and reappering every four seconds.
- Fix typing indicators in buflist for DMs and MPDMs.
- Only fetch members for joined channels when getting history, prevents unnecessary requests and rate limiting (fixes #775).
- Fix issues with the `thread_messages_in_channel` option in certain channels (fixes #664).
- Support notifying thread messages for old threads (parent message is out of the backlog) and before channel history is loaded (fixes #619, fixes #754).

- Store message ts in line tags instead of misusing `date_printed` (fixes #514).
- Disable print hooks when printing old/debug messages (fixes #629, fixes #756).
- When changing latest message in a channel, print new lines if needed (previously, the lines would be joined if the new version of the message had more lines than the old, and this is still the case for older messages).
- Remove buffer notify option for unmuted buffers (fixes #746).
- Fix buffers not changing color in buflist when (un)muted.
- Fix thread bot messages appearing in channel instead of thread (fixes #749).
- Set correct localvar type for threads in pms (fixes #789).
- Use `slack_timeout` for websocket connection (relates to #793).
- Don't display the typing indicator for muted conversations (PR #794).
- Print error message when sending message fails (relates to #797).
- Don't escape <>& in me messages (fixes #704, closes #822).

## 2.6.0 (2020-05-06)

### Features

- Support subscribing to threads, showing which threads are subscribed to and marking threads as read (PR #758). Note that subscribing and marking threads as read only work when you use a session token. Read more about it [in the readme](https://github.com/wee-slack/wee-slack#4-add-your-slack-api-tokens).
- Don't notify about threads when they're opened in the channel (PR #763). This can be controlled with the new option `notify_subscribed_threads`.

## 2.5.0 (2020-03-25)

### Features

## 2.1.1 and earlier

Unfortunately, no changelog has been written for these versions.
